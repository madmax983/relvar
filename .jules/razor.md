## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** Single-variant enums `UnionError`, `IntersectError`, and `DifferenceError` in `relvar-core/src/algebra/` acting as unit structs but declared as enums.
**Cut:** Converted them to unit structs (`pub struct UnionError;`, etc.) to simplify error handling and reduce boilerplate, aligning with the KISS principle.
**Saved:** Unnecessary enum matching and boilerplate code.

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** Single-variant enum `ScalarValueError` with a single variant `NotUserDefined` acting as a unit error.
**Cut:** Converted to unit struct `pub struct ScalarValueError;` for consistency and to reduce boilerplate and nested code matching.
**Saved:** Unnecessary enum matching for single error condition, simpler `return Err(ScalarValueError);` rather than `return Err(ScalarValueError::NotUserDefined);`

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** Single-variant enum `ScalarTypeError` with a single variant `TypeMismatch` acting as a unit error struct but containing fields, in `relvar-core/src/types/scalar.rs`.
**Cut:** Converted to struct `pub struct ScalarTypeError;` with fields for expected and actual types for consistency and to reduce boilerplate and nested code matching, aligning with the KISS principle.
**Saved:** Unnecessary enum matching for a single error condition.
## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** Single-variant enum `RelationError` in `relvar-core/src/values/relation.rs` acting as a unit struct, with an unused variant `DuplicateTuple` and only one used variant `TypeMismatch`.
**Cut:** Converted to unit struct `pub struct RelationError;` with `#[error("Tuple does not conform to relation type")]` directly. Removed the unused `DuplicateTuple` variant.
**Saved:** Unnecessary enum matching, simplified error handling code significantly.

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** Layer Lasagna (deep folder hierarchies with low file counts).
**Cut:** Flattened `relvar-core/src/query/mod.rs` to `relvar-core/src/query.rs`, `relvar-core/src/utils/` to `relvar-core/src/utils.rs`, and `relvar-core/src/storage_engine/` to `relvar-core/src/storage_engine.rs`.
**Saved:** Multiple unnecessary nested directories and improved codebase navigation speed.

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** Factory Factory (Builders for objects taking only a few arguments).
**Cut:** Converted `MockRelation` builder pattern in `relvar/src/experimental/mock.rs` to a simple standalone `generate_mock_relation` function.
**Saved:** Unnecessary struct definition, builder chaining methods, and cognitive load for test creation.
