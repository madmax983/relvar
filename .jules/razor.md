## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** Single-variant enums `UnionError`, `IntersectError`, and `DifferenceError` in `relvar-core/src/algebra/` acting as unit structs but declared as enums.
**Cut:** Converted them to unit structs (`pub struct UnionError;`, etc.) to simplify error handling and reduce boilerplate, aligning with the KISS principle.
**Saved:** Unnecessary enum matching and boilerplate code.

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** Single-variant enum `ScalarValueError` with a single variant `NotUserDefined` acting as a unit error.
**Cut:** Converted to unit struct `pub struct ScalarValueError;` for consistency and to reduce boilerplate and nested code matching.
**Saved:** Unnecessary enum matching for single error condition, simpler `return Err(ScalarValueError);` rather than `return Err(ScalarValueError::NotUserDefined);`

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** Single-variant enum `ScalarTypeError` with a single variant `TypeMismatch` acting as a unit error struct but containing fields, in `relvar-core/src/types/scalar.rs`.
**Cut:** Converted to struct `pub struct ScalarTypeError;` with fields for expected and actual types for consistency and to reduce boilerplate and nested code matching, aligning with the KISS principle.
**Saved:** Unnecessary enum matching for a single error condition.
## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** Single-variant enum `RelationError` in `relvar-core/src/values/relation.rs` acting as a unit struct, with an unused variant `DuplicateTuple` and only one used variant `TypeMismatch`.
**Cut:** Converted to unit struct `pub struct RelationError;` with `#[error("Tuple does not conform to relation type")]` directly. Removed the unused `DuplicateTuple` variant.
**Saved:** Unnecessary enum matching, simplified error handling code significantly.

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** `KeyConstraints::would_violate_on_insert` was a zombie method only used in its own tests, while the actual validation logic in `ConstraintManager` used lower-level methods (`would_violate`). The method also returned a convoluted `Result<Option<Vec<String>>, KeyConstraintError>`.
**Cut:** Deleted `KeyConstraints::would_violate_on_insert` and its associated isolated tests.
**Saved:** Unnecessary abstraction layer and roughly 50 lines of zombie code and tests.

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** `MockRelation` used a "Factory Factory" (Builder Pattern) merely to accept two simple configuration arguments (`count`, `seed`) alongside the mandatory `relation_type`.
**Cut:** Flattened the builder pattern by removing `count()` and `seed()` methods, and modified `MockRelation::new` to accept `(relation_type, count, seed)` directly.
**Saved:** Boilerplate builder pattern methods and simpler instantiation at call sites.
